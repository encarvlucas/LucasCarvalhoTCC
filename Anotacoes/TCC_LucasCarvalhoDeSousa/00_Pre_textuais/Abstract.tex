This work aims to create a Python library for particle flow simulations that is structured using object oriented programming and analyze the results of cases applied to turbomachines.
The Finite Element Method was used to solve the system of equations derived from the stream function-vorticity formulation of the Navier-Stoakes equation for a incompressible and newtonian fluid.
For the particle behavior modeling, the Finite Difference Method was applied to solve the Basset–Boussinesq–Oseen equation, considering one-way interactions, without taking to account the effect of the particles in the flow.
