class PlaneSurface(SurfaceBase):
    """
    Creates a plane surface.

    Parameters
    ----------
    line_loop : Object
        Each unique line in the line loop will be used
        for the surface construction.
    holes : list
        List of line loops that represents polygon holes.

    Notes
    -----
    The first line loop defines the exterior boundary of the surface;
    all other line loops define holes in the surface.

    A line loop defining a hole should not have any lines in
    common with the exterior line loop (in which case it is not
    a hole, and the two surfaces should be defined separately).

    Likewise, a line loop defining a hole should not have any lines
    in common with another line loop defining a hole in the same
    surface (in which case the two line loops should be combined).
